## Homology and Domain Based Search Tools
This repository provides scripts  for homology and domain-based searches in transcriptomes or proteomes

## 1. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) 
- BLAST is the most commonly used tool and allows you to find similar sequences by aligning your query against local or online databases
- Local BLAST is highly recommended for fast searches on large datasets, high-throughput analysis and custom database searches  

## 2. Pfam (Protein Family Database)
Pfam provides HMM profiles for protein domains. Using HMMER tools, you can detect conserved domains in your protein sequences
